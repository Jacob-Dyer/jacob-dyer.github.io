Never in my life has there been a faster moving field than Generative AI. As such, this content is current as of February 2025, and is probably old and irrelavant any time after that.

My role in higher-ed is, in essence, producing videos for use in learning and teaching. So yes, maybe this topic is cutting a little close to home, and maybe I don't have a clear picture of it because of that. I do certianly have a higher bar than most as to what I consider "good enough" when it comes to the quality of AI-genrated video, but the quality issue is an issue that will disapear with time. While today's models might still make videos that give people the heebie-jeebies, tomorrow's ones won't - it's only a matter of time. So with that in mind, what are the plausible use cases in the now and near future of GenAI authored videos in higher ed?

## 1: Lecture Content
This is where everyone's mind goes as soon as they hear about synthetic avatars generated en-masse. To me, this is the last place you'd want to get synthetic video - if you care about teaching[^1]. [Research abounds](https://staff.acu.edu.au/our_university/centre-for-education-and-innovation/educational-technologies/creating-video-resources/multimedia-design-principles) as to how we can make video-based learning more effective for student learning (Mayer, 2024) and how we can use it to build social connection with the students, even in a one-way delivery mechanism like flipped classrooms. This is important to get right, and it's not something I'd trust to the synthetic videos of today. Gestures (Li et al., 2019)  can have a marked effect on learning, as can your tone (Suen & Hung, 2024) and your facial expressions (Schneider et al., 2022). With synthetic video, you loose control of that. From my experiments, getting a natural delivery is not guarenteed just by uploading a script, it takes some work to massage the script to work with the model and get what you want out of it. When you're explaining tricky concepts, the way you present can have a really big impact on how that information is perceived by your audience. See the two videos below for a comparison of Fake Jacob and Real Jacob. Which one do you think is the stronger or clearer delivery?

On an infinite timeline, these models will get better, and the presentation style of the avatars will improve. They'll lose the ['uncanny valley'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley) stigma, and be indistinguishable even to ourselves. But will they ever understand your domain to the extent that they can explain it better than you? Well, probably, but just how soon I guess depends on your skills as an instructor. The question I would ask is this: if you're a teacher at heart, why would you want to completly outsource that aspect of your job?

For now I give synthetic video 2/5 stars for creating lecture content.

## 2: Student Feedback
One thing that my avatar can do that I cannot is scale. I only have so much time in the day, but if I can mass-produce some scripts for my avatar, I can happily generate as many videos as my wallet can bear. To test this out, I took a copy of one of my third-year education essays from my undergrad, and the rubric, and fed it all to Claude 3.5 and gave it the following prompt. 

> "What I need you to do, is to formulate a script for an AI Generated video that will give me feedback about my work. It should reference my work, the rubric, areas I did well in, and areas I could improve next time. The script should be short, no more than 200-300 words. It should be casual in nature, constructive in tone, but also succinct."

I didn't think much of the script it gave, but of course I could spend a lot longer refining that prompt to get something better than I could apply to all my marking. For comparison, I also took my lecturers _actual_ feedback they gave me, and put that through as an alternate script. See the two videos below.

EMBED Actual Feedback

Here's a video of me, directly addressing the student, giving feedback on an assignment. This seems like a great use of this tech, right? Timely personalised feedback  (whether augement with GenAI or not) is _fundamental_ to student learning (Hattie, 2012), but is this the best way to get it across?

What's easier for students to understand, this video feedback, or the script I provided to the model? In this instance, I believe that video here is _not_ the better medium for this sort of feedback. While the presentation and tone perhaps could soften some critical feedback, ultimately its just a more time-consuming way to communicate the same feedback to the student. It's not in my opinion inherentaly superior to written feedback, and instead it cost me hard cash and probably increased global temps my a miniscule amount.
